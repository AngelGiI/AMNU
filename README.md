  Algorithms for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

- *Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):*  
  - General implementation of the SVD algorithm.
  - Applications to image compression using SVD.

- *Least Squares Methods:*  
  Solving over-determined systems using least squares approximation.

- *Numerical Methods for ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations):*  
  - **One-Step Methods:** Implementation of methods like Euler or Runge-Kutta.  
  - **Multi-Step Methods:** Algorithms for solving ODEs using multi-step approaches.  
  - **Predictor-Corrector Methods:** Combined iterative approaches to enhance accuracy.  
  - **Stiff Systems:** Numerical techniques for handling stiff differential equations.  
  - **Adaptive Methods:** Adjusting step sizes dynamically to balance precision and computation time.
